* Exercises in class. During the active exercises, a topic will be discussed and many examples and tasks will be solved. You will find the practical solutions in the **$course-work** folder
* Self-study exercises. After the end of most of the exercises, self-study tasks will be given to improve your understanding of the concepts we have examined. You can find the homework assignments in the **$home-work** folder
